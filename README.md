<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript

This is a website for Bariste Coffee Shop. Using SCSS and CSS, it is responsive on any screen. 

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site allowed me to make a good looking, responsive site, while taking a deeper dive into SCSS. Getting the pictures the same size, and trying to keep 
all of the text on the site responsive and aligned gave me a few hurdles to overcome on this project.
